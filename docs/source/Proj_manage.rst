Project managment
=====

It is relatively simple to come up a derivation for a single package, however if we have many packages/environments to be managed within
a project, the number of ``.nix`` files can make the proecss pretty messy.

Luciky **nix** provides a way to manage such a large project better


.. note::

    Nix enables decentralized package definitions, as the packages do not need 
    to be in the same repository to be well defined.
